Short Blog: Gartner insights into Enterprise perspective on Microservices 


## Microservices are not always the answer

### What are microservices?

Microservice architecture is a popular architectural pattern in software development that involves breaking down a monolithic application into smaller, modular services. These services are typically built and deployed independently, and communicate with each other through APIs.

Advantages of Microservice architectures include:

1. Agility: Microservices are small, independently deployable units that can be developed, tested, and deployed independently of one another. 

2. Scalability: Microservices can be scaled up or down independently of each other, making it easier to handle increasing traffic or load.

3. Flexibility: Each service can be built and deployed using different technologies, languages, and frameworks, allowing for greater flexibility in choosing the best tools for the job.

4. Resilience: If one service goes down, it doesn't necessarily bring down the entire application.

5. Risk reduction: By breaking a large monolithic system into smaller, independent services, the risk of a single service failure impacting the entire system is reduced. Additionally, since microservices are independently deployable, it is easier to roll back or replace a single service if it experiences issues.

6. Technology flexibility: Microservices can be built using different technologies, languages, and frameworks, which allows teams to choose the best tool for the job, rather than being constrained by the technology choices of the entire system.


### What about miniservices and macroservices?

However, Microservice architectures are not always the best solution for every problem. They can be more complex and difficult to manage than monolithic architectures, and can also lead to increased communication overhead between services.

Miniservices and macroservices are similar to Microservices, but with some differences. Miniservices are smaller services which can be used to accomplish a specific functionality or feature, and are generally simpler than Microservices. Macroservices are larger and more complex than Microservices, and they can be used to accomplish an entire business functionality.

Microservices are appropriate to use when you have a large and complex application with multiple teams working on it, and when you need to scale your application quickly. On the other hand, Miniservices are appropriate to use when you have a small application with a limited number of features and you need to build them quickly. Macroservices are appropriate to use when you have a large application with a lot of functionality and you want to build them with a team of experts.

### What to consdier before adopting microservices?  
When considering adopting a microservice architecture, there are several factors to consider, including:

1. Complexity: Microservices introduce additional complexity to the system, as each service is a separate entity that needs to be developed, deployed, and maintained.

2. Scalability: Microservices can be individually scaled, which allows for more efficient use of resources. However, this also means that the system as a whole may become more complex to scale.

3. Communication: Microservices need to communicate with each other, which can introduce latency and increase the possibility of failures.

4. Data management: Each microservice has its own database, which can make data management more difficult and requires careful design of the data model and data access.

5. Team organization: Microservices require a high degree of collaboration and communication among teams, which can be challenging in some organizations.

6. Cost: Microservices can be more expensive to develop and maintain, as you will need to set up and manage a larger number of separate services.

Overall, the cost-benefit of microservices should be weighed carefully before adoption and as it requires more investment in terms of development, deployment and maintenance.


### Which one is the best?

There is no right or wrong service. Microservices architecture can provide many benefits in software development, but it's important to consider the complexity and management overhead involved before choosing it as a solution. Mini and Macroservices are also good alternatives, depending on the specific requirements of the application.
Of course, small businesses can use microservice architecture, but it is more expensive to build, deploy and run. Therefore, I don't think it's right to use microservices unless companies have enough money to support them.
